#New Data Type to store things.

#This is the declaration for the list (creation of the list).

my_list = [] 
print my_list

#This adds whatever you want to your list using the append function

my_list.append("item") 
my_list.append("hello")
my_list.append(1)
# print my_list

#You can access whatever you have in your list by using an index.

# print my_list[0]
# print my_list[1]
# print my_list[2]

#You can also modify whatever is in your list; overwriting whatever was in that position.

# my_list[0] = "Hi"
# my_list[1] = "Ola"

#You can also print your entire list

# print my_list
